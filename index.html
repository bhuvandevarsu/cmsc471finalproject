  <h1>Introduction to K-Centering Problem, and the Naive Solution</h1>
  <div class="info-box">
    <h2>The K-Centering Problem</h2> 
    The k-center clustering problem is a common mathmatical situation in which,
    given a set <b>P</b> of n points, our goal is to find the best set of k points, <b>C</b> &SubsetEqual; <b>P</b> such that the maximum
    distance of a point in <b>P</b> to its closest point in <b>P</b> is minimized.

    More simply put, given a set of locations, we want to effectively 
    choose k of those locations as centers, and choose the best ones. A commonly given example would be
    a set of cities, and we want to build k hospitals in those cities. When choosing the hospital locations, 
    we want to minimize the maximum distance a patient would have to travel to reach their closest hospital (e.g. no patient has to travel more than an hour to reach a hospital).

    <br>

    
    More formally, given a set of centers C, the k-center clustering price of P by C is denoted
    by 
    
    <p>
        \[\|\mathbf{P}_\mathbf{C}\|_\infty = \max_{p \in P} d(p, \mathbf{C})\]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that every point in a cluster is within a distance at most 
      \(\|\mathbf{P}_\mathbf{C}\|_\infty\) from its respective center.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Formally, the <i>k-center problem</i> is to find a set <b>C</b> of 
      <i>k</i> points, such that \(\|\mathbf{P}_\mathbf{C}\|_\infty\) is minimized; namely,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      \[\operatorname{opt}_\infty(\mathbf{P}, k) = \min_{\mathbf{C} \subseteq \mathbf{P}, |\mathbf{C}| = k} \|\mathbf{P}_\mathbf{C}\|_\infty\]
    </p>
    <h2>The Naive Solution</h2> 

    The naive solution would be to generate ALL possible combinations of k points from P and
    calculate the maximum distance of each point in P to its closest center in C for every single combination.
    
    Naturally, this is a brute force solution and is extremely inefficient.

    <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
    <ol class="clean-list">
      <li>Generate all possible combinations of k points from P.</li>
      <li>For each possible subset, compute the maximum distance from every point in P to its closest center in C.</li>
      <li>Keep track of the subset C that results in the minimum (maximum) distance.</li>
    </ol>
   
    
    <p>
      Given \(n\) points and choosing \(k\) centers, there are a total of \( \binom{n}{k} \) possible subsets. 
      For each subset, computing the maximum distance from each point in \(P\) to its closest center in \(C\) takes \(O(n \cdot k)\) time, 
      as you need to check the distance for each point in \(P\) against each center in \(C\).
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the overall time complexity of this naive solution is \(O(n^k) \cdot O(n \cdot k) = O(n^{k+1} \cdot k)\).
      This incredibly inefficient time complexity makes the solution infeasible for any real data set of scale, 
      and clues us in to the complexity of the problem, and need for more advanced algorithms.
     </p>

     Below, we demo the naive solution on a smaller subset of our data,
     slicing it to only \(n \leq 30\) points, and solving for \(k \leq 4\) centers.
